## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development. Our app is totally written in kotlin.
- [Different Layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout) -  In this app we have used difrenet layouts to make the app UI responsive. The used layouts are LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout and FrameLayout .
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)-The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview?authuser=2) - RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. To show large lists.
- [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) - MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface logic from the business (or the back-end) logic. Its target (with other MVC patterns goal) is to achieve the following principle ‚ÄúKeeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage‚Äù.
